# Fabrikam

Fabrikam Fiber is one of several case studies intended for use with Scrum.org's Professional Scrum Developer class. For more information on the Professional Scrum Developer program, visit [Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/courses/professional-scrum-developer-training)

Fabrikam Fiber is a fictional company that provides cable television and related services to the United States. They are growing rapidly and have embraced the latest Microsoft technologies in order to scale their customer-facing web site. This will allow the end users to create/manage tickets and track technicians in a self-service way. There is also an on-premises ASP.NET MVC application for their customer service representatives to administer customer orders.

Note:
The Fabrikam Fiber web site uses the local SQL database. When your Visual Studio 2017 installation includes the workload "ASP.NET and Web development", then you have a local installation of  "SQL Server 2016 Express LocalDB" and the web site will work automatically. In case you are having troubles connecting to the database, check whether you have other SQL Server versions installed. You may need to edit the web.config and change the connection strings to "(LocalDB)\MSSQLLocalDB". See http://bit.ly/2v4qQyQ for more information.
